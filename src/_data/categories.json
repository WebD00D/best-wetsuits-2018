We'd read the brochure and seen the promotional material, but the question remained: was this graphene stuff actually any good? Armed with Billabong's Furnace Ultra 3/2 and Furnace Carbon 4/3, we took to the frigid waters of Santa Cruz and sampled this Nobel- Prize-winning fiber's warmth and comfort capacities."

        "The only perceivable advantage Feral had against its mainstream competitors was their actual wetsuit material. Yamamoto rubber, hailing from Japan, is widely regarded as the premier neoprene on the market. It's more densely packed than other types of rubber, which means there's less room for water to slip between the cracks and be absorbed by the suit. This results in a theoretically lighter and drier body bag. Those quantitative benefits are great on paper, but the Yamamoto's single greatest perk was its gentle, caressing feel against the skin. Seriously, it's like silk pajamas. Once you slide in, ya never wanna get out."

From the second we slipped into O'Neill's historic neoprene, it became apparent that their wetsuits were absurdly stretchy and comfortable—more so than any other brand in our test, and it wasn't even close."
